          2001. Our products are used by a community of dedicated musicians,
          sound designers, and artists from across the world.

          Making music isn&#39;t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But
          when you&#39;re in the flow, it&#39;s incredibly rewarding.

        <article class="less-pron-article">
          We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
          behind Ableton is our passion for what we make and the people we make
          it for.

          We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided
          between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and

          Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
          use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
          professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
          and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the
          shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to
          contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
          culture.

          Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
          people what they need to work their magic and grow. We&#39;ve learned
          that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
          richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
          perspectives. We don&#39;t always agree with each other, but opinion
          and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively
            supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on
            applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
            development and music salons are a chance to discuss new
            technologies, production techniques and best practices.

          If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and
          paperwork. We&#39;ll even provide you with free German or English
          lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive
          health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous
          maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it&#39;s
          not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the
          year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
